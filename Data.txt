my name is Cow, and wen its nite, or wen the moon is shiyning brite, and all the men haf gon to bed - i stay up late.  i lik the bred. my name is Dog, and wen i see a littil pal, a frend for me, beneef the ground insyde a hole - i come up close.  i lik the mole.  When Little Timmy surfed a site And gaily picked a thread, He laughed aloud with deep delight At every word he read.  He skimmed a hundred happy tales Of misbegotten youth - Of fond affairs and funny fails, And other twists of truth!  So Timmy shared a story too, Then settled back and sighed. But somehow someone somewhere knew.  And Timmy fucking died. Remember how we used to smile To share a foolish thought? To simply wait and walk a while? To talk of all, and nought?  We'd spend our days and nights as two, Content to stare above. I always felt the same with you - It seemed a sort of love.  And so we made it something more - But something came to end. We never found what came before.  I miss my finest friend.  'Good waiter, I'm wanting the pasta, you see - But pollo's appalling, and isn't for me! I'd rather abstain and avoid the unknown - So bring me the chicken, and chicken alone.'  I warily, wearily tried to explain - 'But pollo is chicken,' I whispered in vain. 'That bird with the feathers that clucks with its beak? That's pollo; that's chicken,' I struggled to speak.  'See pollo's just chicken by some other name - They aren't independent! They're one and the same! So whether it's chicken or pollo you pick - Whatever you ask for, you're still getting chick!  'In essence,' I finished, 'despite how it seems - 'It's chicken, that's pollo, and that's what it means.' He stared at me silent, and held up a hand. He thought for a moment.  'I don't understand.'  'Dearest mother,' I said, with a shake of my head, 'It's not meant for above, but below. It's designed for the lips that are nearer your hips,' But she smiled and she whispered: 'I know.' This world isn't easy - It's hard on your own - We're richer united, and poorer alone.  It's fine to ignore it - For better or ill - To scorn it before it collapses your will.  But if you can fight it - Or choose to be strong -  Perhaps you can right it, repairing a wrong.  It's plainly apparent - It's simple to see - Together, we'll weather whatever will be.       I should have hurried youth, in truth, And moved more quickly on - I should have made the most of youth, Before the time was gone.  I should have followed fancy, free,  Before it thought to fade - I should have picked a good degree, Or found myself a trade.  I should have stopped to stare above; To share another's dreams - I should have never welcomed love, And lost it all, it seems.  No matter what the aim or end - No matter what you do - Regrets are part of life, my friend:  Don't let them conquer you.    'She doesn't come?' he softly said, And slowly thought it through. He sighed aloud and shook his head.  '... My wife must have it too.'     Often awkward, often tricky. Slightly clumsy, lightly sticky. Mostly harmless, mostly boring. Madly hopeful. Sadly snoring.  Pouting. Doubting. Dull and dreary. Klutzy thrusting, weak and weary. Semi-humpy. Semi-bumpy. Jarring, sparring, loud and lumpy.  Indecision. Arm-collision. Best, affection. Worst, derision. Intermittent. Inconsistent. Unimportant.  Non-existent.  I think I think I used to think, But now I think no more - The thoughts I always thought I thought, I thought, I think, before.  And now, I think, I think a thought Infrequently, and so - The rarer thoughts I think I think Are lesser thought, you know?   So shed the thoughts you think you think, And when your thoughts have shrunk - You'll see the thoughts you thought you thought Are better thought unthunk. A regular human walks into a bar - He orders the first of his drinks from afar. The barman is silent. The man turns around. They stare at each other, an-  PUNCHLINE NOT FOUND. He wandered away as she stared with surprise - A shimmer of wonder and love in her eyes. 'What is it?' I said, and she spoke through the tears:  'It's just, he's been dead for the last seven years.' my name is Nut, and wen i see a tastey bone thats ment for me - a scrummy snak, a yummy fing - i tayke a look.  i dip the wing. When Little Timmy bought a car To drive himself to town - He journeyed places near and far, With all his windows down.  'Oh how I love to see the sun,' He said and sighed within - 'I think it's such enormous fun To feel it on my skin!  'And what a joy it is to know,' He gladly spoke with glee - 'That while I'm driving to and fro, No harm can come to me!'  He dropped his window down at last. He warmed his arm, and sighed. But melanoma travels fast.  And Timmy fucking died.    'Perhaps a change of posture, please, And with a wink,' he said: 'A playful tease upon your knees - Your arms above your head!  'Compose a pose with poise,' he tried: 'A shot with just the coat. You've crazy, carnal lusts inside - Emote!' he cried: 'Emote!'  'Perform a pout or two for you, And every peeping Tom! ... I guess the last will have to do.  I've worked with better, mom.' I stared at it silent, and struggled to speak - It glanced from an eye, with the hint of a beak; A soupy suggestion of wings and a leg; A half-finished creature, inside of an egg.  'You want me to eat it?' I asked with a frown: 'To feast on a fetus and swallow it down? To crunch it for lunch or to munch it for tea?'  'Oh yes,' he replied, '... it's a delicacy.'  'Afternoon, me tasty crumpet - Wanna shag, you sexy strumpet? Shake your arse, m'lady, linger - Only joking, cheeky minger!  'Heard about the bleedin' brexit? Bugger me, an awful exit! Total bunch of slags and plonkers - Dozy wankers, bloody bonkers!  'Load of bollocks - self-defeatist! Takes the piss, me dear and sweetest! Pot of tea?' he kindly queried.  '... What the fuck?' she whispered, wearied. My friend is good. He say good boy. He always tell me true. And when he glad and full of joy, I know that I am too.   I feel a feeling in my heart - A little thing and then - I know he sad and do my part To make him joy again.  He all I think a friend can be. I love you, boy, he say. He like to spend his time with me -  And everything okay. His eyes begin to slowly close. His arms and shoulders droop. He slumps in silent, still repose.  She softly whispers: 'boop.' 'What up, mah amigo? What's happening, dude? I hate to be rude and I hate to intrude: But maybe my baby, my buddy, my bro - There's something important I need you to know:  'You're rotten. You're rancid. You're rank and you reek. Your anus is heinous, you foul-odoured freak. You're filthy. You're fetid, you have to admit. Go jump in a shower.  You smell like a shit.' 'Our hearts beat together; our breaths were the same; We kissed in the darkness, and kindled a flame. Our bodies were one in the warmth of her bed.'  She stared at me, silent.   'Stop rhyming,' she said. 'A gift,' they cried, 'from us to you! A word,' they sighed, 'or rather two! To say,' they said, and grinned with glee, 'An anglicised vulgarity!  'Imagine, friend,' they softly spoke, 'A phrase to share with friendly folk! A noun of note to suit your needs In time for times of foolish deeds!  'The finest word in all the 'sphere Is yours to hold, to have, to hear! So long,' they said; 'goodnight, good luck!'  ... And so it was that shitstorm stuck. 'You scoundrel, bounder, gadabout! You lily-livered, lazy lout! You scallywag! You cad! You loon! You splifficated shabbaroon!  'You spatherdab! You rattlecap! You misbegotten ginger-snap! You knuckle-dragging, interbred, And chicken-hearted, chuckle-head!  'You popinjay! You blatherskite! You scobberlotching zounderkite! You mumblecrust! You maggot pie!'  '... I know you are, but what am I?' 'So what you're suggesting in essence,' he said, 'Is simply pretending we're single instead? You want me to loiter, devoted to you - But never acknowledge we're better as two?  'You want me to linger,' he said with a sigh, 'While you're on the lookout for some other guy? You want me to offer my hope and my heart - While constantly acting as though we're apart?  'You want me to simply submit and agree? To hope for the day when you'll settle for me? To wait while you actively push me away?' 'Precisely,' she answered. He whispered, '... okay.'   Temptation comes in many shapes, And many forms between - A light delight, or small escapes From life's mundane routine.   Temptation's often sweet, but still Your choices take their toll - And life is meant to teach you will, And strength and self-control.  Temptation's hard to check - to wit: Temptation's tough to fight. But as you're not a piece of shit, You'll try to choose what's right.  'Perhaps,' I sighed, 'it's time we tried A sexy switch, or two - A simple change, or something strange To keep it nice and new.  'I've often thought, as lovers ought, That lusts appear to lull - And then, in time, what was sublime Begins to fade and dull.  'And so, my sweet, we'll start, replete With dreams from which to pluck - Tonight instead - tonight,' I said:   'Tonight... I'll be the duck.'     quack.   Though it's so inconsequential, Unimportant, non-essential, Measly, meagre, mean, and minor, Friends, I think there's nothing finer - Nothing quite as strongly suited, Nothing quite as undisputed, Nothing quite as apt for telling Whether someone's so repelling - So, companions, on reflection, Here's your basic dick-detection: Simply pick your chosen loser.  Count the stickers on his cruiser. I know what he's thinking - He's thought it before. He stares for a moment, a minute, or more. Suspicions unspoken - Hypothesis hid. I lean in towards him, and whisper: 'I did.'  They tell me she's sprightful, delightful, and sweet; A pleasure to treasure from fingers to feet - The fondest and fairest to savor and see; Divinely and finely refined as can be -   They tell me she's lovely, a lady of lust; That many a suitor has boomed for her bust - Bodacious, flirtatious, rapaciously wild; Exciting, inviting an evening beguiled.  They call her the siren; the cock-chomping-chick; The princess of penis; the damsel of dick; A fan of the phallus; a ball-hungry-bomb - They call her seductress... but I call her mom. Finger foods or meats and menus? Fancy bars or pricey venues? Lists and vendors? Cakes and dresses? Invitations? Second guesses?  Weddings come with all selections - Make it suit your own affections! Plan for May, or June, December, Set your date, but oft remember:  If you're panicked, planning through it - Think of why you chose to do it. No expensive horse and carriage Ever helped to make a marriage!      The war was waged; the battle raged, And Greece had dwindled, dead - The States were done; they'd brought a gun, And shot themselves instead.  They criticised and pulverised, And posed and postured too - And England came with heaps of blame To frame the whole EU.  They charged ahead, and Russia said: 'It's time to make them pay!' And all the Swiss were all amiss, And France had run away.  And when at last the fight had passed, And one had rose supreme - Came Italy, who cried with glee: 'We make the perfect team!' "Mr. Putin, highfalutin, Opposition executin', Gas reroutin', world pollutin', Crazy KGB recruitin', Crooked, lying, fact refutin', Harsh injustice institutin', Rival shootin', Mr. Putin -  What's with all the persecutin'?" Though reddit's moms are often game, This really isn't quite the same. She's found her final fond affair - A man with which you can't compare.  He's strong and stylish, sexy, sweet, And noble, naughty, nice and neat. He's O.P's mom's, and well, you know -  She only wants Briangelo. 'I really think,' he softly sighed, And slowly shook his head, 'It's time I tried,' he spoke with pride, 'To spread my seed!' he said.  'I'll swiftly send it out to space, The moon, or maybe Mars - A cosmic interstellar race To fertilize the stars!  'I'd love to stand, at noon or night, And stare above to see - Beyond that milky, endless sight - A little bit of me.' You feel it beneath you, or somewhere behind - The pit of your stomach, the back of your mind. A thought or a feeling that doesn't belong - The strangest sensation that something is wrong.  It comes in an instant, and lingers about - A twist of suspicion, a trickle of doubt. A feeling remaining a moment or two - A vague understanding of what might be true.  So open your mind if it's stubborn or shut - And trust the emotions that start in your gut. It might just be nothing, that notion you've got - It might be mistaken... but maybe it's not.  A thousand rhymes a thousand times - A thousand works of art - A song or two on something new, Imbued with you, and heart -  And so you play - it doesn't pay, And though it takes a while - There's something neat, and awful sweet, In making others smile.   I am the wind beneath the trees. The whispers in your ear. The warm and gentle summer's breeze. The voice you long to hear.  I am the blue beyond the sky. The shadow shade of night. The softest sparkle in your eye. The morning glare of light.  I am the rhymes that ride the tide. The swing, the sound, the beat. The lines that swell and slip and slide In stanzas, small and sweet.  I am the secret silver seams That weave inside your mind. I am the lost and tender dreams You dared to leave behind.  I am the storm. I am the sea. The unison. The split. I am the you. I am the me.  And also full of shit. 'I don't understand it,' he whispered in thought - 'She screamed, so we gave her whatever she sought! A mountainous fountain of presents galore! But now it's just louder.   ... Perhaps she needs more?'  Always kissing, always groaning. Always craving, always moaning. Always sexy, always steamy. Lewd and lusty. Deep and dreamy.   Touching. Clutching. Fond and feeling. Rough and ready, clothes revealing. Sexy sweating, not forgetting sweet seduction. Heavy-petting.  Satisfying. Sultry-sighing. Flaming, frenzied, pleasure-crying. Titillating. Liberated. Fascinating.  Fabricated.  Remember what we used to do, And how it used to be? I always knew to count on you, And you, depend on me.  I guess we drifted out of touch - But that's the thing, they say. It's not that friendships end, as such.  They simply... slip away. The hardest lessons learned in life Are dealt and earned with grief - A hundred spans of pain and strife; A stretch of lost belief.  No matter what, or why, or when, Or how, and who's to blame - It comes around, and comes again, And always hurts the same.  I've failed a thousand times before. I've felt my chances fall. I'd rather fail a thousand more Than never try at all. She stared at me, silent, and stood in the snow: 'But how can you do this, and where will I go? You love me. You need me. This just isn't fair.'  'Oh darling,' I whispered: '... I don't really care.'  Scarfs and shawls and garbs and guises - Garments made in all the sizes! Sweaters, stockings, drapes and dresses - Endless clothes at vast excesses!  Shifts and wraps for all occasions - Slips and skirts for all persuasions! Closets crammed to breaking, brimming - Tiny two-piece suits for swimming!  Gorgeous gowns for celebrations - Silver pendant decorations! Beads and bracelets! Rings and lockets!  ... Slightly tragic lack of pockets. The doctor was saying: 'Good golly, my dear, How splendidly strange and how perfectly queer! We've quested and tested and taken your blood - But more than we ought to, and more than we should!  'The answer's surprising,' he said with a smile, 'And worried the best and the brightest a while! The surgeons and doctors and dentists were dazed - They pondered, befuddled, and wondered, amazed!  'You see,' he explained with a wink of an eye, 'To start with your heart's in the shape of a pie! Your stomach's a sausage, and not to be rude - Your kidneys are cookies!  ... You're so fucking screwed.' On a tide of under-thunder, Up it chundered, Splashed asunder, Leaking, reeking, Stenchy-stinking, Out and over, Soaking, sinking.  Friends and neighbours, Would-be-courters, Others, lovers, Sons and daughters - Learn from hasty blunders heinous.  Never force it out your anus.  You don't need a measure of treasure to fly - To sporting success on a broom in the sky... To Eros alone in the sight of the stars... To space on a ship that's intended for Mars.  You don't need a mountain of money to go - Where Peter and Susan await in the snow... Where planets contend and defend for a spice... Where Alice adventures with Hatters and mice.   You don't need a wallet of wealth and of worth - To start on a journey across Middle-Earth... To fight in the night with your sword and your steed.  You don't need a fund or a fortune to read. 'You're beautiful, darling,' she said with a sigh - 'But if you're not healthier sooner you'll die. I love you, and care, and I swear that it's true:  You're beautiful, darling - but this isn't you.' You'll wrap them in linen, or covers and coats - In castles of comfort surrounded by moats - In pads and in pillows as far as you see... And still they will be who they're wanting to be.  You'll keep them from pain and discomfort and strife - Astray from the dangers and hazardsof life - Away from the troubles of risk and attack... And offer a hand while you're holding them back.  You'll want them beside you by night and by day. You'll know it's not right, and it isn't the way. You'll hope that they've wisdom. You'll hope that they're tough.  You'll do what you can, and you'll hope it's enough.  'I stand forever strong,' I swore, 'In bitter war with bait - I must be boldly brave and more, And unafraid to wait!  'I must be wise; I must be true; I mustn't bear defeat - I must be deeply daring too, And deftly doubt deceit!'  In dark, approached the Duke of Death, With claws that curled and hooked - I drew a deep, determined breath.  'WHAT'S THAT?!' he said. I looked. 'There may be cabs with great designs - With nicer shapes or neater lines - With sweeter shades of red and black -  But ours will stop a fucking stack.'  If I could cruise the past and choose Across the sands of time - I know the dame I'd deign to name, To spend a night, sublime.  She's famed and crowned the world around, By dusk, by dawn, by day - The first in line, but twice divine (And thrice as fine, they say).  She's foxy, fair, and few compare; Seductive, cute, and keen - A risky chick; the dame of dick. My only pick: the Queen. He practiced the jests and the jokes that he'd play - He patiently polished his puns for the day. 'I'm pregnant,' she said, and he grinned at her, glad.  'Hi pregnant,' he whispered with feeling: 'I'm dad.' If roses are red as the rouge in your cheek - As perfectly pure as the pledges you speak - As fine and as fair and as sweet as your smile - As simply ascendant, resplendent in style -   If violets are blue as the hue in your eye - As smooth as your skin and as soft as your sigh - I solemnly swear and declare that it's true:  They don't think it be like it is but it do. They came in a line with a hunger for fries - A heavy-armed army with guns on their thighs. A quiet disquiet. A unit in queue. Beware the Mclitia: They ain't lovin' you. When Trump and Clinton met to spew A turd of lies and doubt - They thought, perhaps, a drug or two Would help to ease them out.  'A little intellect for me,' Said Donald, loathe to wait - 'Or something strong,' said Hillary, 'To keep me standing straight.'  And so they lingered on no more - They took their pills with pride.  And Clinton hit the fucking floor, And Donald fucking died. He stares at the slogan imprinted in white - A message for morons to share with delight - A meaningless mixture he reads with dismay - 'It's nonsense,' he mutters, and wanders away.  But then, in a flurry of worry and doubt, His birthday arrives and he starts to freak out. He looks to his shirt with a wave of alarm.  His clothing reminds him it's time to be calm.  'There's a motion in the ocean, There's a ripple in the tide - And I've got a nasty notion There's a yeasty beast inside -  'There's a creature in the rushes, There's a critter in the deep - And it sloshes and it slushes, And its salty splashes seep -   'There's a monster made of embers, With a blemish on its soul - And it's seeking mighty members Of a width to fill its hole -  'There's a void as large as China, And a pit as dark as sin - And it's got a huge vagina, And they call her Evelyn.' With joy and excitement, he posted his thread - 'I wonder what answers they'll give me?' he said. 'Perhaps some advice on the best way to start? The finest of moves for the amorous art.'  And so, with elation, he waited a while - He opened his inbox and read with a smile. Misguided. Mistaken. Misread and misquote. He frowned with confusion.   'Not movies,' he wrote. I had planned my first endeavor - But the world had plans for me. I am lost, but not forever.  I am where I'm meant to be. There's a laugh on her lips, and a light in her eye, And a warmth in her voice, and a smile in her sigh - There's a heart on her sleeve, and it's sweetest to see When she's keeping a secret she's keeping for me.        Should you choose to DIY, NBD, but FYI: Foolish folks are DOA.  AKA: be careful, K? 'Now look,' said the Genie, 'I told you before: The problem with wishes - you can't ask for more! The burden of curses condemns you for time! I can't grant you wishes. I can make you rhyme!'  And so, with the wave of a hand and a smile, He grinned with delight and he laughed for a while. He left the accursed in a sorcerous fog - Forever bedevilled to rhyme...for_your_sprog.    If you should fray, or fall apart, In any where or when - I'll always try, with all my heart, To make you whole again.  But if you choose to fall behind, And break and shake to bits - The day may come where I won't find A single piece that fits. 'Though catapults obtain results In any given war - A trebuchet, I like to say, Is capable of more.  'A suited sling is quite the thing For hurling lumps of stone - A counterweight is twice as great Than wood and springs alone!  'They're big, it's true, but mighty too, And that is why, you see - That in the end, my finest friend, It's trebuchets for me.' When Little Timmy fucking died, And in the After, woke - His court appointed specter sighed, And rubbed his eyes and spoke:  'I'm sorry lad - it's looking bad,' He blew a breathless breath; 'You didn't plan,' he whispered, sad - 'You didn't save for death.  'It's gonna cost a deal indeed, This afterlife, for you - You've all your former pets to feed, And house forever too!  'Of course, you'll need to move the ax Protruding from your head - And then there's after-passing tax, And rental fees,' he said.  'I'm sorry, lad,' he spoke again: 'You did the worst you could. There's really nothing for it then -  You'll have to work... for good.' Be true to you, I've heard it said - Be brave, and pave your way - And never choose to change instead For someone else, they say.  But if I'm who I'm meant to be, And nothing more will do - Then why does no one think of me The way I think of you?        'It's only cheese!' my friend replied, And slowly shook his head - 'But if it makes you mad,' he sighed, 'Then clean it up!' he said.  I didn't fret; we didn't fight; I wasn't sore or sad. I let it ride, until the night I ate his mom and dad. 'When you're angry at life, and you're losing your way - I can't always promise I'll know what to say. I don't have the answers; I can't make it clear - And sometimes I'll speak and you won't want to hear.  'You won't always like me; you won't think I care - And sometimes you'll feel like I'm being unfair. You'll look for a reason, or someone to blame - And maybe at times I'll be feeling the same.  'But think for a moment, And know that it's true - In all that you are, and in all that you do - When doubting, or pouting, or angry at me -  I'll love you forever whatever will be.' It isn't easy being me - The task with which I'm tasked. I'm made the way I'm made to be. I do the job they asked.  I stay up each and every night And when it's time to ring - Or when I see the morning light, I lift my hands and sing.   They slowly rise from out their beds, But still it's me they blame - They click their way to reddit threads, And curse my lowly name.   So think of me, and all I do, When next you hear the tock - It's only what you want me to.  Sincerely yours,  A Clock.   'Her beauty,' he pondered; 'her beauty,' he said - '... Was fruity?' he tried, with a shake of his head - '... Was snooty?' he ventured, and picked up his pen - '... Was booty?' he started, and started again.  'Her beauty was really, amazingly... well - It sort of was super, and making him... swell?' He buried his head in his hands with a sigh. He pondered improvements, and gave them a try.  'Her beauty was flawless - but that's not enough - Her face was a vision of grace and of... stuff? Her skin was the shade and the colour of... spam? Her hair was a fancy, a picture of... damn!'  And when he was finally finished at last - When ages of pages and pages had passed - When lines were completed, repeated, and read - He nodded, contented.  'It's perfect,' he said.   I laugh to see the mirror me. His eyes are cold and black. I grin with hazy, drunken glee.  He isn't smiling back. 'It isn't crude! It isn't rude!' He laughed and shook his head. 'I didn't really mean it, dude - It's just a joke!' he said.  I thought upon these 'fun' assaults, And then, without ado - I catalogued his flaws and faults, And tore his soul in two.  I said he'd never made a friend; He'd never find a date; His lost and loveless life would end; He'd gained a heap of weight.   I said he'd mastered pointless pride, With groundless mounds of smarm: 'A piece of human filth,' I sighed, 'Without an ounce of charm.'  And when, at last, he stopped to cry At every word I spoke - I heard him sadly whisper: 'why?'  And said: 'It's just a joke.' When Little Timmy went to school, With stores of silver spare - He thought it might be kinda cool To make his way by air.  'Of course you can!' his father said, And laughed with rich delight - 'It's only right to plot ahead, And plan your path by flight!'  So Timmy left without a doubt, And landed, flushed with pride. But Timmy leaped too highly out.  And Timmy fucking died. 'Where's my hug?' he asked her, smiling, Smugly sleazy grin beguiling, Coyly calling, teasing wily -  'Somewhere else,' she answered drily. 'I've got it!' said Satan, and grinned with delight: 'May all of their sneezes arrive in the night! May all of their tables be crooked!' he cried: 'May of all their laces be loose and untied!  'May all of their digits be stubbed till they bleed! May all of their captchas be vexing to read! May all of their dinners be slow to defrost! May all of their keys be departed and lost!  'May all of their queues be unbearably long! Forever relentlessly stuck on a song! Forever upsetting and spilling their drink! Forever less steps on the stairs than they think!'  He giggled, demented, and wiggled with joy! He chuckled, contented, and pleased with his ploy! He danced and he bopped and he bounded and bounced!  'And let there be stones in their shoes!' he announced. 'So which are you doing?' I said with a sigh, And patiently waited to hear their reply. They answered with 'neither', and laughed at me, bold.  I beat them with sticks till they did what they're told. Wave goodbye your ego, brother.  Kiss your kids and call your mother. Tend your burn and take your ointment.  You're a fucking disappointment. Whenever I'm lonely and lying in bed, With shame, I remember the sentence he said. I think of the words, and I weep at them, sad: 'It's time for a breakdown,' and that's what I had. The trouble with testing a person in short: It comes with a flaw of the tricksier sort. You measure their strengths, or their skills, or their smarts - But people are more than the sum of their parts.  You can't take an answer and call it the 'self' - Or bottle a person to place on a shelf. There isn't a test with the reach or the range To gather a nature that's tending to change!  Perception's dependent on context and case - On bias, conditions, intentions, and place - On how the partaker endeavors to be. I don't want a label.  I'd rather be me. "Yoo-Who!"  'Twas night, and the children were dreaming their dreams - Of mustards and custards and cookies and creams! Of trips to the future, and ships to the stars! Adventures to Saturn, and journeys to Mars!  They turned in their slumber and peacefully slept - But down through the kitchen, a shadow had crept! It crept through the stairway; it crept through the hall - It crept through the bedroom, and stopped at the wall!  'I'm waiting,' a whisper emerged from within - 'It's time to delight in a night full of sin! The children are sleeping; the husband's away - I'm willing and wanton and wanting to play!  'The love of another is precious to find - But better's the lusts of an other in kind! Excite me, delight me, and better I'll be - Fulfil me and fill me, instil me with glee!'  And so, with a tickle, a whimper, a sigh - The crack of a whip and a moan and a cry - She treasured the pleasure, and saw it was true.  A Who likes to do who a Who likes to do. The softer squash of smoother skin; The subtle squeeze serene. The way it slowly shifted in; The way it slipped between.  The lusty, thrusting sound it made; The ruffled, muffled squeak. The mellow fade of yellow shade; The test of questing beak.  The way it felt to face the end; The under, thunderstruck. ... You've never truly lived, my friend, Until you've tried the duck.   Fewer things are more perturbing, More distressing, More disturbing, Disconcerting, Vile and vexing, Daunting, haunting, half-perplexing, Nauseating, Aggravating, Misbegotten, rotten, grating, Frightful, Sad, And simply chilling - Than a load of kitten killing.     I always hoped I'd have some more - Another year, or two. A month, a week, a day before Our days were done and through.  But life is blind, and deaf, and dumb To simple hopes and dreams - And just before the moment's come, The moment's passed, it seems.  So savour every fleeting night, And every fading day - And take the time to make it right... Before it slips away. When Little Timmy took an 'E' To while away the night: 'I barely felt a thing,' said he, And spoke, 'this can't be right.'  He waited half a second's span - A moment more, or two - And when, at last, the next began, He wondered what to do.  'Perhaps it takes a few before It settles in,' he sighed. So Timmy swallowed sixty more.  And Timmy fucking died.  There's no earthly way of knowing, Which direction she is blowing - There's no knowing where she's blowing, Or which way the semen's flowing -  Is he cumming, is he going? Are the seeds of pleasure sowing? Not a sign of woe is showing, So his member must be growing.  Are the fires of lusts a-glowing? Is it almost overflowing?  Yes, his member must be growing, For the goer keeps on going, And she's certainly not showing Any signs that she is slowing...   I've worked beside the cruel and cursed; The worst across the land - But forum mods are fucking first For assho-   [user banned]. 'Good golly, how jolly! How funny,' said God - 'How strangishly strange and how oddishly odd! You're fighting and biting and smiting again - It's time I demanded commandments of ten!  'Though gods are a blast and a riot of joy - A party of pleasure to treasure, my boy - I'm certainly certain, I'm sure you'll agree, There's no one who's wholly more holy than me!  'Devotion's the notion of honour and truth - Don't bridle it worshipping idols in youth! If 'Jesus!' or 'Heavens!' you're heard to have cursed -  That's blasphemy, brother, and christ, it's the worst!  'A Sunday's a fun-day for glory begun - For hymns to the brim, and for songs by the ton! Remember to cherish your mommy and dad; They messed you up good, but they aren't all that bad!  'Adultery, stealing - they're pleasant, of course - But totally banned with celestial force! They share a perception; it's perfectly clear - Don't take what you haven't acquired sincere!  'Be honest, contented, and pleased with your load - Don't weep full of woe for the wealth that you're 'owed'; Be happy and clappy and merry in mind - Be spriteful, delightful, and kindly-inclined!  'But mightily, vitally valued of all - No matter the reason, enormous or small - Don't murder another. Go forth, and go far.  And don't eat crustaceans. Those things are bizarre.'  Softly swimming, Drifting, floating, Dreaming dreams of boats and boating - Rowing, riding, Going tiding, Over, under, Graceful gliding.  Drying after, Darkly dressing - Something sudden, So distressing. Interruption. Lights are glaring. And I'm naked.  And she's staring.  'Sick and tired of woeful wiping, Dull discomfort, paper swiping? Had your fill of sadly bearing Dry displeasure, tissues tearing?  'Never fret, my poopy beauty! Never fear to do your duty!

'Introducing Tushy-Licker! Lush and slick and kind and quicker! Wave goodbye to horrors heinous!  ... Let it gently tongue your anus.'   I remember the way That I thought about love - It was rockets and bells, It was dreams from above. But it came without fuss, And it came without flair - And before I could look, It was already there.  I remember the way... But I cannot recall How it happened to be That you asked me at all. See it wasn't a shock, 'Cause we already knew That your future was me, And my future was you. 'Excuse me,' I said with a sigh and a smile, 'I've looked all around and I've waited a while. I've patiently pondered. I've stopped for a drink - But nothing appears to be coming, I think!  'Perhaps you've a sample of amorous scenes? An amateur orgy of neighborly teens? A meeting of pretty wee titties and cocks? A sexy selection of midgets in socks?  'So tell me,' I whispered: 'Oh what will it be? Oh how will it happen and what will I see?' She showed me a toilet and told me to sit.  And that was the day that I jacked it to shit.  'I came here to say this, just sayin', the feels - You see what I did there, for science, fo' realz? Did nazi it coming, Anne Frankly it's grim - Fuck Jenny, m'lady, but [f]irst hit the gym!   I lost it at fiddy - my mind's fuckin' blown! Rule 1: Be attractive, forever alone. Dafuq am I reading? A cool story, bro. Be gentle, kind stranger - you nailed it, you know?  Is circlejerk leaking? It's better with rice. See here's why we can't have the things that are nice. Your jimmies are rekt, but it's risky and sold! I'll have to allow it - and thanks for the gold.' It started with stories; With words and a smile. Awaiting your answers, And reading a while; Expecting perspectives, By day and by night - It started with talking, And talking till light.  It started with hearts, And it started, it seems - With passion, perfection, And half-finished dreams. It started with hopes, And with love-laden sighs... And ended with silence, And  One Word Replies. 'Did I whisper? Did I stutter? Did I fucking ask for butter?  How the hell's it hard to cater? God, no wonder you're a waiter!  This is what you get for hiring Fucking kids in need of firing! Fucking kids of any ages - Don't you know I pay your wages?  Take it back and make it better - Colder, cooler, warmer, wetter! Did I order sauce for dipping?  ... Oh, I did? Well I'm not tipping!'   'Steven's stinky! Steven's smelly!' 'Sally's gross and mostly belly!' 'Steven's ugly, rank and reeking!' 'Sally's so attention-seeking!'  'Steven's stupid! Steven's simple!' 'Sally's full of snot and pimple!' 'Steven stole my plastic pony!' 'Sally's friends with two-ton Tony!'  'Steven's filthy! Steven's frightful!' 'Sally's selfish! Sally's spiteful!' 'Children,' mother said, placating:  '... Both of you are irritating.' When Little Timmy bought a bike, He didn't care for rules - He challenged trucks and cars alike, And wouldn't slow for schools!  'The road was only made for me,' He pondered, speeding passed - 'To get me where I need to be, As swiftly fleeting fast!'  He rode it close and keen and quick - He rode with risk and pride! But Little Timmy lost his dick.  And Timmy fucking died.
